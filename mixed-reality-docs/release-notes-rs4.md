# Release notes - RS4

Welcome to Windows Mixed Reality! The release of the **[Windows 10 April 2018 Update](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/04/27/make-the-most-of-your-time-with-the-new-windows-10-update)** includes new features for both HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets on desktops. 

To update to the latest release for each device, open the **Settings** app, go to **Update & Security**, then select the **Check for updates** button. On a Windows 10 PC, you can also manually install the Windows 10 April 2018 Update using the [Windows media creation tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10).

 **Latest release for Desktop:** Windows 10 Desktop April 2018 Update (**10.0.17134.1**, Windows 10 April 2018 Update)
 //TODO Need to update **Latest release for HoloLens:** [Windows 10 Holographic April 2018 Update](release-notes-august-2016.md) (**10.0.14393.0**, Windows 10 Anniversary Update)

## Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets

The Windows 10 April 2018 Update includes many improvements for using Windows Mixed Reality headsets with your desktop PC, such as: 

* A brand-new environment called Skyloft that you can navigate to by selecting Places on the Windows Mixed Reality Start menu.
* You can now take mixed reality photos directly from your controller by holding the Windows button and then tapping the trigger. This works across environments and apps except for capturing content protected with DRM.
* The automatic performance settings have been updated to provide an optimized experience, and weâ€™ve added a new setting to override the default in Settings > Mixed reality > Headset display > Experience options.
* Setup now provides more detailed information about common compatibility issues with USB3.0 controllers and graphics cards.
* Create animated 3D launchers for your applications and place decorative 3D objects in the Mixed Reality Home from your apps and websites
* Experiment with custom Windows Mixed Reality home environments

With this update of Windows, support for Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR has also exited early access and brings additional features including support for haptic feedback when using motion controllers, improved performance and reliability and improvements to how motion controllers appear in SteamVR. 

## Known issues

We've worked hard to deliver a great Windows Mixed Reality experience, but we're still tracking some known issues. If you find others, please [Give us feedback](give-us-feedback.md).


### Visual quality
* If you notice after the April 2018 Update that graphics are more blurry, or the field of view looks smaller on your headset, the automatic performance setting may have been changed in order to maintain a sufficient framerate on a less powerful graphics card (such as Nvidia 1050). You can manually override this (if you choose) by navigating to **Settings > Mixed reality > Headset display > Experience options > Change** and changing "Automatic" to "90 Hz." You can also try changing **Visual quality** (on the same Settings page) to "High."

### Windows Mixed Reality setup
* When setting up Windows with a headset connected, your PC monitor may go blank. Unplug your headset to enable output to your PC monitor to complete Windows setup.
* If you do not have headphones connected, you may miss additional tips when you first visit the Windows Mixed Reality home.
* Other Bluetooth devices can cause interference with motion controllers. If the motion controllers have connection/pairing/tracking issues, make sure the Bluetooth radio (if an external dongle) is plugged in to an unobstructed location and not immediately next to another Bluetooth dongle.  Also try powering down other Bluetooth peripherals during the Windows Mixed Reality sessions to see if it helps.

### Games and apps from Windows Store
* Some graphically intensive games, like Forza Motorsports 6, may cause performance issues on less capable PCs when played inside Windows Mixed Reality.

### Audio
* If you have Cortana enabled on your host PC prior to using your Windows Mixed Reality headset, you may lose the spatial sound simulation applied to the apps you place around the Windows Mixed Reality home. The work around is to enable "Windows Sonic for Headphones" on all the audio devices attached to your PC, even your headset-connected audio device:
   1. Left-click the speaker icon on the desktop taskbar and select from list of audio devices.
   2. Right-click the speaker icon on the desktop taskbar and select "Windows Sonic for Headphones" in the "Speaker setup" menu.
   3. Repeat these steps for all of your audio devices (endpoints).
>[!NOTE]
> - Another option is to turn off "Let Cortana respond to Hey Cortana" in **Settings** > **Cortana** on your desktop prior to launching Windows Mixed Reality.

* When another multimedia USB device (such as a web cam) shares the same USB hub (either external or inside your PC) with the Windows Mixed Reality headset, in rare cases the headset's audio jack/headphones may either have a buzzing sound or no audio at all. You can fix this by your headset into a USB port that does not share the same hub as the other device, or disconnect/disable your other USB multimedia device.
* In very rare cases, the host PC's USB hub cannot provide enough power to the Windows Mixed Reality headset and you may notice a burst of noise from the headphones connected to the headset.

### Holograms
* If you've placed a large number of holograms in your Windows Mixed Reality home, some may disappear and reappear as you look around. To avoid this, remove some of the holograms in that area of the Windows Mixed Reality home.

### Motion controllers
* Occasionally, if you click on a webpage in Microsoft Edge, the content will zoom instead of click.

### Desktop app in the Windows Mixed Reality home
* Snipping Tool does not work in Desktop app.
* Desktop app does not persist setting on re-launch.
* If you're using Mixed Reality Portal preview on your desktop, when opening the Desktop app in the Windows Mixed Reality home, you may notice the infinite mirror effect. 
* Running the Desktop app may cause performance issues on non-Ultra Windows Mixed Reality PCs; it is not recommended.  
* Desktop app may auto-launch because an invisible window on Desktop has focus. 
* Desktop User Account Control prompt will make headset display black until the prompt is completed.

### Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR
* You may need to launch Mixed Reality Portal after updating to ensure the necessary software updates for 1803 have completed before launching SteamVR. 
* You must be on a recent version of Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR to remain compatible with the 1803 update. Make sure automatic updates are turned on for Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR which is located under the software section of your library in Steam.  

### Other issues
* An early version of the 1803 update pushed to Insiders (version 17134.5) was missing a piece of software necessary to run Windows Mixed Reality. We recommend avoiding this version if using Windows Mixed Reality. 
* We've identified a performance regression when using Surface Book 2 on the initial release of this update (10.0.17134.1) that we are working to fix in an upcoming update patch. We suggest waiting until this has been fixed before updating manually or waiting for the update to roll out normally.
